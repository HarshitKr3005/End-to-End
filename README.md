# Student Performance Indicator - End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## Introduction

This project aims to predict student performance indicators based on various factors such as demographics, socioeconomic status, study habits, and other relevant features. The goal is to create a machine learning model that can assist educators and administrators in identifying students who may require additional support to improve their academic performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [provide_dataset_source]. It contains information about students including demographic details, socioeconomic status, family background, study habits, and previous academic performance.

## Features

The features in the dataset include:

- **Demographic Information**: Gender, age, race/ethnicity.
- **Family Background**: Parental education level, family size, family support.
- **Socioeconomic Status**: Parental occupation, household income.
- **Study Habits**: Time spent studying, attendance, completion of assignments.
- **Previous Academic Performance**: Grades in previous subjects, standardized test scores.

## Preprocessing

Before building the machine learning models, the following preprocessing steps are applied:

- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling numerical features.
- Feature engineering (if necessary).

## Modeling

Several machine learning algorithms are explored to predict student performance indicators, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

These models are trained and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated using cross-validation and holdout validation techniques. The model with the highest performance metrics is selected for further tuning and optimization.

## Deployment

The selected model is deployed using AWS to make predictions on new data. A user-friendly interface is created to input student information and obtain predictions regarding their performance indicators.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in predicting student performance indicators. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, educators can identify students who may require additional support and intervention to improve their academic outcomes.
